00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,360
DAVID MALAN: This is CS50, Harvard University's introduction

3
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,730
for the intellectual enterprises of computer science

4
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,170
and the art of programming.

5
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,660
My name is David Malan, and I actually took this course

6
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,710
myself sophomore year some years ago.

7
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,980
But I almost didn't.

8
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,540
At the time, I was quite uneasy with the idea,

9
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,720
frankly, of taking a computer science course, let alone this course.

10
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,512
And so my freshman year, at least, I really

11
00:01:44,512 --> 00:01:46,340
gravitated toward courses and departments

12
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,860
with which I was much more familiar.

13
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,432
Computer science was well beyond my comfort zone at the time,

14
00:01:52,432 --> 00:01:54,140
and it was really these unfamiliar waters

15
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,290
that I wasn't quite ready to shop, even my first year.

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,070
But sophomore year, I finally got up the nerve to come through the door of CS50,

17
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,160
and only because the professor at the time let me take the course pass/fail.

18
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,110
I was that uneasy.

19
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,240
And if only I had known at the time what I now know,

20
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,320
which is that 2/3 of CS50 students have never

21
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,270
taken a computer science course before.

22
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,230
So if you are feeling similarly uneasy with the idea of trying something new,

23
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,140
or even if you have prior background but are

24
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,890
looking to fill in gaps in your knowledge,

25
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,930
or if you're particularly self-taught, realize

26
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,880
you are very much in good company.

27
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,770
And ultimately, what matters in this course

28
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,330
is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates,

29
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,160
but where you end up relative to yourself when you began, which is,

30
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,570
of course, today.

31
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,730
So what, then, is computer science?

32
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,970
And what was it that I was so uneasy with?

33
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,410
Well, I dare say we can describe computer science as this.

34
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,512
It's just the process of solving problems.

35
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,220
And what does it mean to solve a problem?

36
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,510
You've got some input.

37
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,100
And the goal is to get some output, the solution, to that particular problem.

38
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,540
And in between, really, is computer science.

39
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,290
And we'll see what's in this literal black box on the screen

40
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,610
as we begin to fill in some of those blanks.

41
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,618
But when we consider a problem to be solved,

42
00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:05,660
we have to all agree from the get-go, especially if we're using machines,

43
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,460
how are we going to represent these inputs and outputs?

44
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,120
And so one of the first concepts we explore in computer science

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,210
is how you represent information itself.

46
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,580
And odds are you probably know coming into this course

47
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,752
that computers only speak what language, so to speak?

48
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:20,460
AUDIENCE: Binary.

49
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:20,680
DAVID MALAN: Yeah.

50
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,333
So binary.
